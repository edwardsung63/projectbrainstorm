## Finding Data
### First data set
[Mobile App Store (7200 apps)](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)

The data was collected by Ramanathan,
a Research Engineer at KIT, Karlsruhe Karlsruhe, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.

He collected this dataset using the ITunes Search API which is located on the Apple website.

The dataset contains 7197 rows and 16 columns.

We hope to find a correlation between top rated apps and the category. We also can find out which specific category of apps are the most popular and which also bring in the most revenue.

### Second data set
[17k Apple App Store Strategy Games](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games)

They collected this dataset of over 17000 strategy games on the Apple Store with help of the ITunes API and the App Store sitemap.

The dataset contains 16847 rows and 18 columns.

This dataset will help us see what type of games produce the most money. A lot of games are free but have a lot of ads that generate income for the developer. But many apps also have in app purchases that entice the user to spend money on a free game. Some games are only available through purchase and cannot be obtained otherwise. We can see the correlation to why people spend money on games.
